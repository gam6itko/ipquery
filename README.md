# IPQuery

A fast and efficient IP address query API built in Go. **IPQuery** provides geolocation, ISP, and risk assessment data for IP addresses with a clean API and containerized deployment options.

## Features

- **IP Geolocation**: Retrieve geographical information (country, city, coordinates, timezone) for any IP address
- **ISP Information**: Get autonomous system number (ASN), organization, and ISP details
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify VPNs, proxies, Tor exit nodes, datacenters, and calculate risk scores (via [AbuseIP**DB**](https://www.abuseipdb.com/))
- **REST API**: Simple HTTP/REST endpoints for IP queries
- **Docker Support**: Ready-to-deploy containerized application
- **GeoLite Integration**: Uses [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/) free databases for accurate geolocation data

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This service relies on seeing the real client IP at the edge.
> It must be deployed on infrastructure with a public IP address (VPS or equivalent) and a valid FQDN.
> If you deploy in private-only network and expose the service via tunnels (e.g. Cloudflare or Pangolin) 
> choose the _caddy_ option and expose via Caddy or equivalent. Deployments behind private-only networks only are not supported.

## Installation

### Binaries

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akyriako/ipquery.git
cd ipquery
```

Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

Run the server:

```bash
./bin/ipquery
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t ipquery:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 ipquery:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> That is a simple quick way to run the server, without the risk assessment enricher. For that you need to get 
> an API KEY from [AbuseIP**DB**](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) and set it as environment variable `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`.

### Docker Compose (with Caddy)

Use the included deployment files:

```bash
cd deploy/caddy
docker compose up -d
```

```yaml
version: "3.8"
name: ipquery

services:
  api:
    image: akyriako78/ipquery:0.1.17
    environment:
      LISTEN_ADDR: ":8080"
      TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS: "172.30.0.0/16"
      GEOLITE2_ASN: "/geolite/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb"
      GEOLITE2_CITY: "/geolite/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
      ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    networks:
      ipqnet:
        ipv4_address: 172.30.0.10

  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    depends_on:
      - api
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
    networks:
      ipqnet:
        ipv4_address: 172.30.0.2

networks:
  ipqnet:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.30.0.0/16

```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` with your very own key. **If none is provided, no risk assessment will be performed**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you provide a strong passwords for `KONG_PG_PASSWORD`, `KONG_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a more elaborate setup, but give you the flexibility to take advantage of all the features of Kong Gateway 
> like securing your exposed API endpoints with API Keys and/or impose rate limiting. This docker compose is not
> production-ready, but nevertheless a good starting point to get you going.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Address the HTTP server binds to |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | `127.0.0.1/32,::1/128` | Comma-separated CIDRs whose forwarded headers are trusted |
| `GEOLITE2_ASN` | `./geolite/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` | Path to the GeoLite2 ASN database |
| `GEOLITE2_CITY` | `./geolite/GeoLite2-City.mmdb` | Path to the GeoLite2 City database |
| `GEOIP_RELOAD_INTERVAL` | `60s` | How often the GeoLite2 files are checked for updates |
| `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Enables risk assessment; no risk data is returned without it |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | `json` for log collectors, or `text` for human-readable output |

### GeoLite2 database updates

The databases are reloaded at runtime, so replacing the `.mmdb` files does not
require a restart. Every `GEOIP_RELOAD_INTERVAL` the files are checked for
changes and, if replaced, reopened in the background while lookups keep being
served from the previous database. If a new file turns out to be unreadable, the
previous database stays in use and the error is logged, so a broken update
cannot take the service down.

This works with `geoipupdate`, which writes a temporary file and renames it over
the target.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running in Docker, bind-mount the **directory** containing the databases
> (for example `/geolite`), not the individual `.mmdb` files. A rename on the
> host is invisible inside the container if a single file is mounted, and
> updates will never be detected.

### Logging

Logs are structured, written to stdout, and JSON-encoded by default:

```json
{"time":"2026-08-08T20:59:45Z","level":"INFO","msg":"access","ip":"::1","method":"GET","path":"/own","status":200,"duration_ms":0.075,"agent":"curl/8.18.0"}
```

Set `LOG_FORMAT=text` for a more readable format during local development.
Requests to `/health` are not logged.

## API Endpoints

### `/own`

Resolves your own IP address, returns only the IP as `string`

### `/own/all`

Resolves your own IP address, returns all metadata found in MaxMind GeoLite2 databases as `JSON`, e.g.:

```json
{
  "ip": "141.98.XXX.XXX",
  "isp": {
    "asn": "AS39351",
    "org": "31173 Services AB",
    "isp": "31173 Services AB"
  },
  "location": {
    "country": "Denmark",
    "country_code": "DK",
    "city": "Copenhagen",
    "state": "Capital Region",
    "zipcode": "XXXX",
    "latitude": "XX.XXXX",
    "longitude": "XX.XXXX",
    "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen",
    "localtime": "2026-01-07T12:06:30+01:00"
  },
  "risk": {
    "abuse_confidence_score": 0,
    "usage_type": "Fixed Line ISP",
    "is_tor": false,
    "total_reports": 1,
    "number_of_users_reported": 1,
    "last_reported_at": "2025-11-16T04:30:39Z"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The MaxMind GeoLite2 databases are prebaked in the container image. If you need to provide your own load
> them in volumes and configure `GEOLITE2_ASN` and `GEOLITE2_CITY` environment variables accordingly.

### `/lookup/{ip}`

Resolves the requested IP address, returns all metadata found in MaxMind GeoLite2 databases as `JSON`.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Risk (stanza `risk`) is assessed only if a valid `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` is provided. 
> AbuseIP**DB** is allowing 1000 requests/day on the free tier, which is more than enough for hobby and non-commercial use.
